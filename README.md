# SpriteEditor
Sprite editor for the Commodore 64

This program helps to design sprites for the commodore 64.
It will generate a header file (.h) aimed for the `cc65 compiler`.
This way you could directly insert this file into your program sources.
But by just selecting the produced data you could do anything of course.
